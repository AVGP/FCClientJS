Inofficial BetaFace webrtc demo
===============================

**Warning:** I haven't slept enough, I am under a potentially deadly dose of caffeine 
and I should not operate any heavy machines right now. This code is horrific, ungly and it may harm kittens when you're not watching.

Take this as a fun inspiration and play around with it - but do not go into the code and go "That's how I am going to do it".

# What's this?

With the mucho importante warning aside: This is fun. 

This experiment takes a snapshot of the webcam video stream (also on mobile browsers if they're fresh enough) and uploads it to BetaFace.

You can upload pictures to Betaface and do face detection. You'll get a ``face_uid`` for each detected face.
Enter these into the ``KNOWN_PEOPLE`` array in ``index.html`` and then use the webcam and the small "Go" button to get face recognition...

FUN! :)

There's a [demo video available](http://t.co/OV5aQkPZsw).
